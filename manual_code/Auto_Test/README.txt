The directory contains the object code and source code of two testing cases used in P1 demo.

The obj/ directory contains the object code to be linked with your RTX, one at a time.  You will need to exclude the usr_proc.c file from the build. 

The src/ directory contains the source code of the testing code for your reference only. 

The two sample testing cases published only serve as examples so that you have a better understanding how automated testing code works with the RTX project. The purpose of these two testing cases is not to thoroughly test your code. It is each individual group's responsiblity to test their own RTX. Automated greybox testing during demo is one tool we use to evaluate your project. Students should not expect lab staff to release testing code (object code or source code) before or after the P2 and P3 demos.
